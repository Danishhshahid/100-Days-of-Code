The article on the GitHub repository provides an introduction to TypeScript and its setup. It highlights the main differences between TypeScript and JavaScript:

TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, which means variables, function parameters, and return types can be explicitly defined. This leads to more robust and error-free code, especially in large projects.
JavaScript: A dynamically typed language, where types are determined at runtime, which can lead to more flexibility but also more runtime errors.

and second article is all about setting up the enviroment for typescript.
